Tye typeface is made from only arcs and lines: the shapes used to notate metre in poetry. By changing the brush used to draw the shapes, you can drastically shift the appearance of the typeface. The width of the brush is computed using the shape of a so-called beta distribution. This explains the name, but the typeface is also 'beta' in the technical sense. It is not yet an ordinary typeface, but has been implemented from scratch using Paper.js.
